## Description of the project

This repository is used to keep my programming sharp and learn to use different algorithms and databases. While using unity there's not many algorithms and dynamic programming to practice. So this repository goes over interview questions and gives me a chance to solve them.
I use coding languages like Python and C to get the best practice of higher and lower levels of programming.
