## Description of the project

This repository is used to keep myself sharp and on my toes. Learning unity there's not many algorithms to learn and dynamic programming to practice. So this repository goes over interview questions and my answers.
Practicing with coding languages like Python and C, I get the best practice of higher and lower levels of programming.
